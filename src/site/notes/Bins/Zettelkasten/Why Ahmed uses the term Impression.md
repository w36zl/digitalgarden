Ahmed points out that when talking about affect the distinction between sensation, feeling, emotion and cognition is an analytical one-- because in our experiences they are hard to distinguish. Because of this she comes up with the term impression. As a strategy to no fall back on those analytical terms and approaches.

> I want to suggest that the distinction between sensation and emotion can only be analytic, and as such, is premised on the reification of a concept [...] I will use the idea of ‘impression’ as it allows me to avoid making analytical distinctions between bodily sensation, emotion and thought as if they could be ‘experienced’ as distinct realms of human ‘experience’ (p. 6)
