To distinguish the function of different types of notes, there is less clutter. For example to write down a question can be very helpful for the mind to focus on a given subject but when this question without an answer starts to be put in the main notes it can negatively impact the flow of connecting ideas. 

> It's perfectly acceptable to incorporate questions into your zettelkasten, since these can serve as both placeholders for future answers and prompts for shorter writing pieces. But, questions left unanswered are a somewhat low-value form of content. After all, how will a question help you in your writing if you don't know the answer? Where is the idea you want to get across? In order for questions to become useful, they need to be transformed into something usable
