The museum as  concept zone

> My analysis suggests that sense perception and emotion take place in what I would call the contact zone of impressions; they involve how bodies are ‘impressed upon’ by objects and others. Such a reading draws on a long and diverse philosophical history, including the work of Descartes, Spinoza and Deleuze (1992)

> SA: [Pause] Yes. One of the theorists that I used quite a lot in Strange Encounters was Mary Louise Pratt and her idea of the contact zone and what you’re saying reminds me of that. And I’ve always liked this word ‘contact’ anyway. And obviously it has an etymological relation to ‘contingency’, to touch, to come into contact.

Antwi, P., Brophy, S., Strauss, H., & Troeung, Y.-D. (2013). 'NOT WITHOUT AMBIVALENCE': An Interview with Sara Ahmed on Postcolonial Intimacies. _Interventions_, _15_(1), 110--126. https://doi.org/10.1080/1369801X.2013.771011

In _Strange encounters: embodied others in post-coloniality_ she critiques the concept of the contact zone proposed by [[Inbox/Mary Louise Pratt\|Mary Louise Pratt]] in my understanding she doesn’t draw on the work Mary Louise Pratt 

> In Mary Louise Pratt’s work, the encounter becomes theorised in terms of the contact zone as, ‘an attempt to involve the spatial and temporal co-presence of subjects previously separated by geographic and historical disjunctures’ (Pratt 1992: 7). Here, the encounter involves both a temporal and spatial dislocation that transforms both the colonising and colonised subjects: in other words, colonial encounters involve a necessarily unequal and asymmetrical dialogue between once distant cultures that transforms each one. However, one problem with Pratt’s model of the ‘contact zone’ is the use of a linear narrative that assumes a transition from distance to proximity. I want to suggest that colonial encounters involve a much more complex relationship between proximity and distance. Take, for example, Michel de Certeau’s analysis of travel writing and colonial encounters (1986: 67). According to de Certeau, the travel account involves a search outward for the strange and works through the rhetorical device of distanciation (the ‘appearance’ of monsters and marvels, the documenting of cannibalism and polygamy). The homeward journey almost returns us to the beginning: the writing always returns home, but with a difference. The one who moves through space, or gets closer to the stranger, returns home as almost the savage, as contaminated by the inbetween of the narrative. In his reading, the relationship between travel and writing determines rather than is determined by a spatialising operation whereby the cultural fields of familiar and strange are precariously established.

# how Wekker uses the concept of the contact zone

> #hls My objects of study pertain to dominant white self-representation, to policies, principles, and practices, and to feelings. In my reading, the transmitting of racialized knowledge and affect between the colonial and the metropolitan parts of empire took place within what can be conceptualized as one prolonged and intense [[Inbox/contact zone\|contact zone]] (Pratt 1992). 

#note here the concept of the **contact zone** is used as to point to a location in history in which a self image emerged that has a long lasting effect in the way culture is shaped but also policy and the more 

>It helps to conceptualize the cultural archive along similar lines as Bourdieu (1977) does for habitus, that is, “that presence of the past in the present,” a way of acting that people have been socialized into, that becomes natural, escaping consciousness. The habitus of an individual springs forth from experiences in early child- hood, within a particular social setting, often a family, and Bourdieu un- derstands such processes in terms of class. Habitus is “history turned into nature” (Bourdieu 1977, 78), structured and structuring dispositions, that can be systematically observed in social practices.

# Understanding affect according to Sara Ahmed 

>The idea of ‘companions’ does not do the trick precisely, given the implication that sensation and emotion can part company. Instead, I want to suggest that the distinction between sensation and emotion can only be analytic, and as such, is premised on the reification of a concept. We can reflect on the word ‘impression’, used by David Hume in his work on emotion (Hume 1964: 75). 

The cultural politics of emotion 

#note impression is a very important concept of how affect is understood according to Ahmed— she mostly focuses on the affective politics of racism
