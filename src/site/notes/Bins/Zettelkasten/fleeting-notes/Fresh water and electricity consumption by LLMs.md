The other day, I listened to a conversation on Democracy Now[^1] that highlighted the freshwater consumption required to train large language models (LLMs). The speaker discussed how corporations like OpenAI operate globally, building infrastructure such as data centers in water-scarce environments—places where local populations already struggle to access freshwater. She was drawing a connection between historical empialism and ciolonialism and today’s corporate imperialisms, showing how corporations extract resources without giving back to the communities.

Today, I listened to another podcast called somewhere on earth[^2] where they discussed the energy consumption needed to run these large models. They said that, globally, it could equal twice the total energy consumption of the Netherlands. The question posed was whether we can truly meet the energy demands required to keep these models running—and they admitted they couldn’t answer that with certainty
