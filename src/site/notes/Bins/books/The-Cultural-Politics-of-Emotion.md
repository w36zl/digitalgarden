# Introduction: Feel Your Way (pp. 1-19)

It reminded me on how I want to write how different literature is has a particular effect on me and how this effect is changing how i relate to the world around me— it’s also made me think on her comments of movement, so 

> To show how my thinking has been informed by my contact with some works on emotion (p. 4)

## EMOTIONS AND OBJECTS
(pp. 5-8)

>If emotions are shaped by contact with objects, then emotions are not simply ‘in’ the subject or object (p. 6)

It explains why emotions and this process of signification is relational and not relative

Connection with the concept of the [[Inbox/contact zone\|contact zone]] she mentions contact more often
## INSIDE OUT AND OUTSIDE IN
(pp. 8-12)

> Movement may affect different others differently: indeed, as I will suggest throughout this book, emotions may involve ‘being moved’ for some precisely by fixing others as ‘having’ certain characteristics. The circulation of objects of emotion involves the transformation of others into objects of feeling

Feminist standpoint theory this is what I find truly beautiful feminist standpoint theory that different people can experience the same situation, but I have a different relationship to the situation and how they emotionally respond to that situation. 

> lack of self-presence is articulated as ‘the unconscious’. Working with Freudian psychoanalysis, I will show how objects get displaced, and consider the role of repression in what makes objects ‘sticky’

she is talking about the circulation of objects and how she draws on psycho analysis and Marxism when she talking about sticky objects she is talking about the role repression has in making objects sticky. it made me think of the word repression-- RE-PRESS-ION and that sounds it is the repetition of pressing that makes the shape, so when she's talking about sticky objects what she has also named affective saturation. She is talking about affect? Which is described as the circulation of emotions that shape the surfaces of objects?

The RE in REPRESSION encapsulates the iterative process. 

>Emotions in their very intensity involve miscommunication, such that even when we feel we have the same feeling, we don’t necessarily have the same relationship to the feeling. Given that shared feelings are not about feeling the same feeling, or feeling-in-common, I suggest that it is the objects of emotion that circulate, rather than emotion as such. My argument still explores how emotions can move through the movement or circulation of objects. Such objects become sticky, or saturated with affect, as sites of personal and social tension.

# The concept of radical empathy is situated in the interpersonal domain of power in the way I understand the space of affection

When I came across [[Inbox/radical empathy\|radical empathy]] i directly related this concept to the [[Inbox/interpersonal domain of power\|interpersonal domain of power]] because it it talks about the intersubjective space where individuals are willing to be affected this also describes so beautifully what I always have meant with the [[Inbox/space of affection\|space of affection]] 

>anthropologist Joan D. Koss-Chioino argues that empathy in healing relationships “creates an inter-subjective space where individuals,” regardless of their prior relationships to one another, enter into “intimate relation.” In its extreme form, “individual differences are melded into one field of feeling and experience,” a phenomenon Koss-Chioino describes as “radical empathy.” [...] Our conception of empathy is radical in its openness and its call for a willingness to be affected, to be shaped by another’s experiences, without blurring the lines between the self and the other [@caswellHumanRightsFeminist2016]

## From a document
### Space of Affection

A space that’s not physical but is visceral
A space that's not visible, but is real
A (un) spoken sense of consent
A process of reciprocal learning exchange
A space that emerges in the overlap between belongings and the day-to-day routines
A space that emerges through recognition  
A space that can instantly emerge while conversing in the streets
A space/event that affects the way information digests in terms of the bodily, emotional and intellectual interplay 
Acknowledgment of difference and commonalities
A potential for change
A space and/or a state (the possible states of a given agent)  

### Geographies of belonging and daily trajectories

the location “you’ve” inherited in a given society, through 500 years of European colonialism
the connect and disconnect between place and belonging
the entanglement between culture and place
the relationships between routines and cultures
the ethics that are embedded in corporate, school and work cultures
the relationships and belongings that emerges from speaking to one another in a zoom conference
how place and space is not always physical but always connected to specific geographical locations
 
the red dashed circle is signified as daily trajectories the blue dashed circle is signified as belongings or the other way around.

The space that emerges because of the overlap which is named space F 
Space of affection emerges in space F 

the sense of a group of people, like minded , doing similar stuff, empowers me.
It make me feel I belong.

## Statement thesis

Meaningful encounters mean the world to me. The combination of elements that through the artistic practice of a person are coming together differently - such as intellectual, emotional, bodily ways of understanding a specific domain in life - , together with the agency that enables solidarity through personal contact,  is amazing to me. Art to me is a collective learning environment, a space for experimentation in how to transmit agency

### Politics of location

>Like walking, mapping is an embodied experience carried out from a particular point of view that _“makes possible both the finiteness of my perception and its opening out upon the complete world as a horizon of every perception[1](#sdfootnote1sym).”_ It is considered a way to locate ourselves in the world, allowing us to make sense of our situation and to act on it

PoL in practice: source multiple perspectives-experiences of body-place entanglements space of affection production of new emerging subjectivities on how to imagine differently

The space of affection has always been about the consensual learning exchange in the context of emancipatory processes

# Glossary 

## Affective economies 

>in this book I offer an analysis of affective economies, where feelings do not reside in subjects or objects, but are produced as effects of circulation (see Chapter 2). The circulation of objects allows us to think about the ‘sociality’ of emotion

## Impression

1. an idea, feeling, or opinion about something or someone, especially one formed without conscious thought or on the basis of little evidence: his first impressions of Manchester were very positive | they give the impression that all is sweetness and light
2. a mark impressed on a surface by something: the impression of his body on the leaves
3. ORIGIN: late Middle English: via Old French from Latin impression-), from impress- 'pressed in', from the verb imprimere (see imprint)

**Source**: Oxford dictionary of English 

### Notes

So is the concept of impression is the uniting entity connect the analytical terms of sensation, emotion and cognition together

>I want to suggest that the distinction between sensation and emotion can only be analytic, and as such, is premised on the reification of a concept [...] I will use the idea of ‘impression’ as it allows me to avoid making analytical distinctions between bodily sensation, emotion and thought as if they could be ‘experienced’ as distinct realms of human ‘experience’ [...]  in this book I offer an analysis of affective economies, where feelings do not reside in subjects or objects, but are produced as effects of circulation (see Chapter 2). The circulation of objects allows us to think about the ‘sociality’ of emotion 


## sociality of emotions 

Affective economies explains the sociality of emotions

Sociality of emotion is a different model of emotionality then for example the inside outside model of emotion
